# Library Project

This is my version of The Odin Project's library project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).

**Link to project:** https://hddev8.github.io/library-project/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Library entries (Books) are created by submitting form values. Books are created using a constructor function. Each entry is added to a library array. I use CSS Grid for the layout. Each entry's card can be toggled "Have Read" or "Have Not Read," which also changes the entry's value within the library array.

## Lessons Learned:

I was proud to make a toggle button that changes the value of its corresponding Book instance. I would like to refactor the code to be better organized. A later lesson says to refactor with Factory Functions, which I would like to do at some point.
