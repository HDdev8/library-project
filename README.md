# Library Project

This is my version of The Odin Project's library project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).

**Link to project:** https://hddev8.github.io/library-project/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Library entries (Books) are created by submitting form values. Books are created using a constructor function. Each entry is added to the library array. I use CSS Grid for the layout. Each entry's card can be toggled "Have Read" or "Have Not Read," which also changes the entry's value within the library array.

## Optimizations:

I would like to refactor the code to be better organized, and I would like to try Factory Functions as an alternative to Constructor Functions. Among other things, I would use localStorage, which I've just begun to learn.

## Lessons Learned:

I was proud to make a toggle button that changes the value of its corresponding Book instance. I learned how to use "this" and constructor functions. I learned about preventDefault() when submitting a form. I was happy to create an overlay as well as a form that pops up after clicking the button to bring it up.
